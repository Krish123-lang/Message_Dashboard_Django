* Each row in the table provides options to delete and mark as read the messages.
* This table is paginated to accommodate a large number of senders and ensure efficient navigation.

* The dashboard prominently displays key metrics, such as the total number of messages and the number of messages sent today, giving users an overview of their messaging activity.
* To enhance usability, a global search bar is implemented, enabling users to search for specific messages based on different criteria such as sender name, keywords, or message content. This search functionality allows users to quickly find relevant messages within their inbox.
